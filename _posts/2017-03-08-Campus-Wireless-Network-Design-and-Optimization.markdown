## Abstract

SFU Campus wireless network system provides easy wireless network connectivity for students, staffs and researchers’ computer and electronics device. However, we notice that there are several dead zones on campus where people cannot get stable wireless network connectivity. In this project the team will focus on what causes the problem mention above in SFU campus and optimized solutions to improve wireless network connectivity. To achieve the goal of this project, the team will use wifi-mesh technology to build a new wireless network environment in SFU campus and use riverbed to simulate it to see its performance compare to the existing wireless network.
