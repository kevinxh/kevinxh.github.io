## Abstract

Wi-Fi provides fast and easy wireless connectivity to mobile devices and computers. It’s flexibility and extended range for local networks make it the most used internet communication standard nowadays. In this project, the team will investigate the evolution history of Wi-Fi standards: __802.11a__, __802.11b/g/n__, and __802.11ac__. The main goal is to find the differences between the Wi-Fi standards as well as the specifications. The team will focus on the speed, frequency and MIMO of the standards. The outcome of evolution brings to our daily life will also be discussed. We will review some of the latest technologies such as __802.11af__ and __802.11ah__ briefly.
