## Abstract

With the increase demand of local wireless communication networks and the amount of data, Ad-hoc was designed to provide a local mobile communication protocol which gives the users with the abilities to transmit data wirelessly without central control unit. Performance and reliability are the focus of Ad-hoc network protocol. Large scaled, complicated and practical simulation scenarios are being used to model such networks. In order to learn and develop the best suitable network implementations that meet user’s demand, this paper will introduce the theory of Ad-hoc network protocol, and provide detailed simulation implementation and process. Routing algorithms such as DSR (Dynamic Source Routing) and AODV (Ad hoc On-Demand Distance Vector Routing) are investigated by setting up static and mobile local network devices. OPNET which is known as one of the best network automation simulation tool is used in this experiment. In the experiment, delay and throughput are the main parameters that will be used to analyze the performance and reliability of the protocol. The self-recovery, dynamic, center-less characteristics of mobile network protocol will be investigated to help readers to gain better understanding of MANET (Mobile Ad-hoc Network).
