#Hello!!

It's been a long time.

I wanted to start my tech blog, just to leave something during my software development that might be helpful to others, and myself.

So, it is today.

Since I will be working on an IOS project that I had absolute zero experience. I think it is a good opportunity to write from beginning of my [Swift](https://swift.org/), [XCode](https://developer.apple.com/xcode/), and IOS related development adventure. I'll be comparing what it is like to develop an IOS native app with web development and others. Hopefully that someone out there in the universe can learn something from this blog. :)
