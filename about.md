Hi, my name is **Kevin He**, and I'm pursuing my Bachelor's degree in Computer Engineering at Simon Fraser University. As a rising senior, my final days in school are quickly approaching. Looking forward, I plan to join the industry as a **Full-Stack/Front-End** engineer.

[<img src="http://www.sage.com/na/~/media/Responsive/images/logo.png" alt="Sage" wwidth="72" height="18" style="position:relative;top:6px;">](http://www.sage.com/ca) My first work experience was at **Sage Software Inc.** as an Automation Engineer co-op in Sage 50 development team. At there I met lots of nice collegues who taught and mentored me in work and gave me useful advices for life. It was my honor to work in such an amazing team. Everyone was like a family member there and I really missed it!

Currently working on web push notification and progressive web app projects. Love the fast-paced environment, love the way Mobifiers pursue and create the latest technology.

I am interested in full stack development from backend to frontend. While my stack of choice is [NodeJS](https://nodejs.org) with [ReactJS](https://facebook.github.io/react/), I pride myself on my ability to quickly learn the languages, tools, and/or frameworks best for solving a problem. I have been working on [RESTful API](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Representational_state_transfer), [MongoDB](https://www.mongodb.com/), [SQL server](https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/sql-server/sql-server-2016) related project.

I'm excited about developing reliable, elegant code and working on products that simplify the lives of others. If you think our interests align, feel free to reach out!
